Intro:
We are doing simulation for ambulances and since it's a simlulation due to which we are limiting thigs like
> We are providing god mode view of all that is happening, 3 in 1
> Not simulating the traffic because we couldn't use Google maps api or any of
the tools we mentioned in project becaues of this whole covid scenario
> But this simluation will give a pretty good idea of how things are 
working

we are going to do the following thing:
1> Already presence of the markers depicting the emergency vehicles
2> Simulate the creations of SOS from the user and selection of a vehicle to green
3> Total number of active vehicles and passive vehicles
4> Another SOS and another sos...and in case of overwhelming odds, nothing
5> Clearing of the case, removal of the marker and go of emergency vehicles
